    "However, there are alternative perspectives that help make sense of the seemingly surprising result. While only $23$ people are required to expect a collision, we are not just making $22$ comparisons. In fact, each new individual added to the group is compared against all the previous ones. Therefore with $23$ people, the number of comparisons is: \n",
