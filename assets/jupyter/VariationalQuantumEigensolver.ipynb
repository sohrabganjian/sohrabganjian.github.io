    "The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum–classical algorithm designed to approximate the ground-state energy of a Hamiltonian $H$ by optimizing a parameterized quantum state $|\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle$. In this tutorial, we assume minimal familiarity with the concept of a quantum Hamiltonian and build the necessary background step by step.\n",

    "We begin by formulating the problem and motivating it through classical mechanics and classical Hamiltonian formulations, before transitioning to  quantum Hamiltonian formulation. Along the way, we introduce tools and concepts, including time evolution operators and representative examples of physical Hamiltonians. We then focus on the hydrogen atom as an example, which allows us to develop intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, we move away from abstract operator formalism toward numerical representations relevant for computation. This includes the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, first and second quantization formalisms, the construction of fermionic Hamiltonians, truncation of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, the choice of finite orbital bases, and the mapping of fermionic operators to qubit Hamiltonians. With this foundation in place, we introduce the VQE algorithm in detail and apply it to the helium hydride cation $\\mathrm{HeH}^{+}$, which served as a benchmark system in the original VQE proposal by Peruzzo et al. in [A variational eigenvalue solver on a quantum processor](https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3061).\n",

    "Finally, we examine the resource complexity of VQE from a heuristic perspective, discuss its limitations and practical considerations, and outline strategies for mitigating its main bottlenecks. We conclude by highlighting several important applications of ground-state energy estimation, ranging from theoretical physics to quantum chemistry and drug discovery. By the end of this tutorial, is is hoped that the reader has a clear understanding of how Hamiltonians are constructed and represented, how VQE is used to approximate ground-state energies and how to interpret its results.\n"

    "Classical mechanics provides the non-quantum description of physical systems and can be expressed through several equivalent formulations. The three core formalisms are Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian mechanics. Although these do not exhaust the full scope of classical mechanics, together they cover a large portion of its foundational structure. These three formalisms are closely related and each is suited to different types of problems. Although we will not explore their full mathematical structure here, we can briefly outline the role of each. Newtonian mechanics uses forces to determine acceleration through $F = ma$. Lagrangian mechanics determines the physical trajectory by selecting the path that optimizes the action $S = \\int (T - V)\\, dt$, where $T$ and $V$ denote the kinetic and potential energies, respectively. Hamiltonian mechanics describes motion in terms of positions $q$ and momenta $p$, whose time evolution is governed by the canonical equations $\\dot{q} = \\partial H / \\partial p$ and $\\dot{p} = -\\,\\partial H / \\partial q$, where $H$ represents the system's total energy. \n",
    "\n",
    "These classical descriptions are particularly important because the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms extend naturally into quantum mechanics. The Lagrangian leads to Feynman’s path-integral formulation, in which quantum amplitudes are obtained by summing $e^{iS/\\hbar}$ over all possible paths, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant that sets the fundamental scale of quantum effects. The Hamiltonian, on the other hand, becomes an operator $\\hat{H}$ acting on states in Hilbert space and generates time evolution through the Schrödinger equation $i\\hbar\\,\\partial_t |\\psi\\rangle = \\hat{H} |\\psi\\rangle$. For example, see [Notes on Quantum Mechanics using Lagrangian approach](https://rgjha.github.io/notes/QMPI_Notes.pdf) on the connection between quantum mechanics and Lagrangian mechanics. "

    "### Time Evolution Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ provides a description of how the quantum system works, the time evolution operator tells us how the quantum system changes over time. The time evolution operator arises from the solution to Schrödinger equation. Note that the Schrödinger equation has two time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) and time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) versions, depending on whether the Hamiltonian depends on time or not. If the Hamiltonian does not depend on time, $\\hat{H}(t) = \\hat{H}$, then the time-evolution operator has a simple closed form: $U(t) = e^{i \\hat{H}t/\\hbar}$ with $|\\psi(t) \\rangle = U(t) | \\psi(0) \\rangle$ and $U(0) = I$, which is the solution to opeartor differetial equation of Schrödinger equation. If the Hamiltonian does explicitly depend on time $\\hat{H}(t_1) \\neq \\hat{H}(t_2)$ the operators at different times generally do not commute, $[\\hat{H}(t_1), \\hat{H}(t_2)] \\neq 0$ meaning a simple exponential is no longer correct. The solution becomes the time-ordered exponential, often called the [Dyson series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_series),:\n",
    "\n",

    "U(t) = \\mathcal{T} e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\int_0^t \\hat{H}(t')dt'}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{T}$, the time-ordering operator ensure the correct oredering of non-commutating Hamiltonians.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum gates can be viewed as instances of time evolution operators. For example, the Pauli $X$ gate can be written as $X = e^{-i \\frac{\\pi}{2} X}$ up to a global phase, and more generally single-qubit rotation gates take the form $R_\\alpha(\\theta) = e^{-i \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\sigma_\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$. The Hadamard gate can be written as $H = e^{-i \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\hat{n}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}}$ up to a global phase, where the rotation axis is $\\hat{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1,0,1)$, so that $\\hat{n}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma} = \\frac{(X+Z)}{\\sqrt{2}}$, therefore, $H = e^{-i \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{X+Z}{\\sqrt{2}}}$. Similarly, the $T$ gate is given by $T = e^{-i \\frac{\\pi}{8} Z}$, and the CNOT gate can be written as $\\text{CNOT} = e^{-i \\frac{\\pi}{4} (I - Z) \\otimes X}$ up to a global phase.

    "\n",
    "The Born-Oppenheimer approximation is an approximation in molecular quantum mechanics that exploits the large mass difference between nuclei and electrons. Since the proton is approximately 1836 times heavier than the electron ($M_p \\approx 1836 \\, m_e$), electrons move much faster than nuclei for comparable kinetic energies. This large mass ratio motivates treating nuclear and electronic motion separately. As a result, the nuclear kinetic term\n",

    "This approximation is extremely accurate for most chemical systems because the electronic motion adjusts nearly instantaneously to changes in nuclear positions. \n",

    "We try to keep this section brief, noting that a deeper treatment of this topic could lead us into a deep forest. So let's avoid going too far and stay focused on our path.\n",

    "In the study of quantum mechanics, as we have seen, it was inspired partially by classical mechanics, and quantization was understood as taking a classical system and turning it into a quantum one. In this sense, it can be viewed as the quantization of particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, first quantization has its own limitations. First quantization describes $N$ particles using a wavefunction $\\psi(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_N)$ in a $3N$-dimensional space. For fermions, which are a class of subatomic particles that make up matter, including electrons, protons, and neutrons, and which follow the Pauli exclusion principle stating that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state at the same time, this wavefunction must be antisymmetrized to satisfy the Pauli principle. This becomes increasingly cumbersome as $N$ grows. Additionally, processes involving particle creation or annihilation are not naturally accommodated in this formalism. Furthermore, first quantization does not incorporate special relativity in a straightforward way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second quantization resolves these issues by working with occupation numbers and creation/annihilation operators, where antisymmetry is automatically enforced through the operator algebra. Relativistic effects also emerge naturally when this formalism is extended to quantum field theory. In this sense, second quantization can be viewed as the quantization of fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preferred choice between first and second quantization is context-dependent and relies on the problem being solved. Thus, expressing the Hamiltonian in the second-quantized form for VQE does not imply that second quantization is universally the better formalism; it is simply the most convenient representation for this computational setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, second quantization provides a natural bridge to quantum field theory, where the fundamental objects are not particles but quantum fields that permeate all of space. In this framework, what we call *particles* are quantized excitations of these underlying fields: an electron is a quantum of excitation in the electron field, just as a photon is an excitation of the electromagnetic field. The *vacuum* is not empty space but rather all fields in their ground state, and particles emerge as quantized excitations of these fields. "

How close the result is to the ground-state energy depends on the expressibility of the ansatz and the optimizer's ability to explore the parameter landscape. Confidence in the output can be increased through several practical strategies. For small systems, results may be verified directly against exact classical methods. More generally, one may perform multiple VQE runs using different random initial parameters and ansatz choices; if the same minimum energy is consistently observed across runs, confidence in having reached the ground state is increased.\n",

    "  VQE typically terminates when the classical optimizer identifies a (possibly local) minimum of the energy landscape $E(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ within a predefined tolerance $\\epsilon > 0$. Smaller values of $\\epsilon$ correspond to higher numerical precision but generally require more iterations and measurement resources. However, satisfying a convergence criterion is not the only reasonable stopping condition. In practice, it is possible that convergence may never be achieved due to poor ansatz expressibility, optimizer stagnation, noise, or the presence of barren plateaus. Consequently, it is standard to impose additional stopping criteria, such as a maximum number of iterations, to prevent indefinite execution. The choice of ansatz and classical optimizer plays an important role in VQE performance. In the original VQE proposal by Peruzzo *et al.*, the Nelder–Mead simplex algorithm was employed. Since then, substantial research has focused on designing problem-informed ansätze and improved optimization strategies to mitigate local minima and improve convergence reliability.\n",

These works laid the foundation for a broad family of UCC-based ansätze, many of which have since been proposed to improve expressibility, scalability, and convergence on near-term quantum hardware."

    "The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum classical algorithm composed of several interacting components, including quantum state preparation, measurement of observables, and classical optimization. As a result, the overall resource complexity of VQE can be understood as the combination of multiple contributing costs. At a high level, the total computational cost of VQE can be approximated as\n",

    "$$\n",
    "Each of these factors is itself composed of several subcomponents. The cost per energy evaluation depends on the number of Pauli terms in the Hamiltonian, the number of measurements required to estimate each expectation value to a desired precision, and any measurement grouping or error mitigation strategies employed. Similarly, the number of optimization steps depends on the choice of ansatz, the optimization landscape, and the classical optimizer used. A relevant question is which part of the VQE algorithm dominates the overall computational cost as the system size increases.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of Pauli terms in the qubit Hamiltonian. For molecular systems, a Hamiltonian acting on $n$ qubits, corresponding to $n$ spin orbitals, contains $N = \\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ Pauli terms. Each Pauli expectation value can be estimated through repeated measurements to reach a desired statistical precision. Consequently, the number of Pauli terms in the Hamiltonian decomposition is the dominant contributor to the computational cost of the VQE algorithm. For a detailed discussion, see [*The Variational Quantum Eigensolver: a review of methods and best practices*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05176) by Jules Tilly et al. As stated in that review (page 12 of 156):\n",
    "\n",
    "> The main bottleneck identified in these studies (based on noiseless estimates) is the substantial number of measurements that are required to estimate the expectation value of the Hamiltonian using VQE\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate this challenge, several strategies have been proposed. One common approach is Pauli grouping, which groups Pauli strings into the same measurement setting when they commute, thereby reducing the number of circuit executions required. Another approach is to reduce the number of qubits by exploiting symmetries in the Hamiltonian through qubit tapering. For further discussion of qubit tapering, see the PennyLane tutorial at https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qubit_tapering. In the worked example discussed earlier, qubit tapering was available but we did not utilize it. The attributes `dataset.tapered_hamiltonian` and `dataset.tapered_hf_state` provide the tapered Hamiltonian and the corresponding Hartree-Fock reference state, respectively. Applying tapering in this case would reduce the system from 4 qubits to 2 qubits, thereby reducing the size of the variational search space and the overall measurement cost. Additional details on tapering operations can be found in the PennyLane documentation at https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.taper_operation.html."

    "Thanks to the [Hellmann-Feynman theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellmann%E2%80%93Feynman_theorem), the ground-state energy serves as a foundation for computing various molecular properties. For instance, the electric dipole moment can be derived from energy derivatives. See [Moments-based quantum computation of the electric dipole moment of molecular systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10758v1) as an example. Similarly, atomic polarizability (the electric polarization of the electron cloud) is obtained by expanding the ground-state energy in the presence of an external electric field. See [Ab Initio Calculations of the Static and Dynamic Polarizability of BaOH](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19564v1) for an instance of this approach. These properties provide valuable information about solubility and dielectric properties (from dipole moments) and optical trapping capabilities (from polarizability), all of which can be derived from the ground state."

    "Furthermore, ground-state energy can be used to compute binding energies, which quantify the strength of protein-ligand interactions, a challenging component in drug discovery. While a complete treatment of drug binding requires calculating binding free energies, which include entropic and thermal effects, binding energies computed from ground states can serve as useful approximations for ranking drug candidates. Under certain simplifications, ground-state energy calculations can effectively prioritize compounds for further development. For a demonstration of this approach using VQE on quantum hardware to rank BACE1 inhibitors (Alzheimer's drug candidates), see [Quantum Computational Quantification of Protein-Ligand Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08163).

    "Ground-state energy has various applications across physics and chemistry, as we have described some of its applications. Beyond its direct role in determining molecular structure, the ground-state energy serves as the essential reference point for understanding excited states. The critical information lies in the energy differences between the ground and excited states. These differences directly correspond to the energies of photons absorbed or emitted by a molecule, forming the basis for all computational spectroscopy. Overall, the ground-state energy is a valuable quantity, as it encodes essential information about molecular structure, electronic interactions, and the physical behaviour of atoms and molecules."

    "We introduced the Variational Quantum Eigensolver and explained that its objective is to approximate the ground-state energy of a Hamiltonian. A major portion of this tutorial was devoted to developing the mathematical and physical foundations needed to understand Hamiltonians, which provide a systematic way to describe the energy of a physical system. In particular, the ground-state energy of a Hamiltonian reveals many important properties of atomic and molecular systems and characterizes the most stable configuration of a system. This information underlies phenomena such as chemical bonding and reactions, and plays a central role in applications ranging from theoretical physics to quantum chemistry and drug discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we saw that there are several choices throughout the workflow that can affect the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. These include the choice of orbital basis used to truncate the Hamiltonian to a finite-dimensional space, the fermion-to-qubit mapping, and the choice of classical optimizer, among others. We also observed that the number of Pauli terms in the Hamiltonian decomposition plays a central role in the overall complexity of VQE, as it directly impacts the number of measurements required to estimate the energy. There are, however, strategies to mitigate this cost, such as Pauli grouping and qubit tapering, which reduces the size of the solution space by exploiting symmetries in the system. A comprehensive overview of these methods and related design choices can be found in [*The Variational Quantum Eigensolver: a review of methods and best practices*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05176) by Jules Tilly et al.\n"

    "While the Variational Quantum Eigensolver is a hybrid algorithm for estimating ground-state energies, it is not the first quantum algorithm proposed for this purpose. Ground-state energy estimation using quantum phase estimation was already explored in the 2005 paper [*Simulated Quantum Computation of Molecular Energies*](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604193) by Alán Aspuru-Guzik et al. Separately, the paper [*Quantum Computational Method of Finding the Ground State Energy and Expectation Values*](https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0789) by Sangchul Oh presents an approach based on adiabatic evolution for computing ground-state energies. What distinguishes VQE from these earlier methods is its hybrid quantum–classical structure and its formulation for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, which makes it more suitable for execution on near-term quantum hardware.\n"

    " - William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865) was an Irish mathematician, physicist, and astronomer who made foundational contributions to algebra, classical mechanics, and optics. While his formulation of Hamiltonian mechanics predates the development of quantum mechanics, but the mathematical framework he introduced later became central to electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and quantum field theory. Hamilton spent most of his academic career as a professor at Trinity College Dublin. The Hamiltonian operator appearing in Schrödinger's equation is named in his honour. In addition, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, Hamiltonian graphs, and Hamiltonian paths and cycles are named after him. He also introduced quaternions, a mathematical framework for describing rotations in three dimensions.\n",
