Quantum homomorphic encryption is a cryptographic primitive that seeks to address these two objectives in the quantum setting, allowing for quantum computation on encrypted quantum data. In this work, we provide a software simulation of a quantum homomorphic encryption scheme, known as the \"EPR scheme\", for universal quantum circuits, developed by Broadbent and Jeffery.<br>We demonstrate the near-term viability of this scheme and provide evidence that the computational cost of classical subroutines in the simulation is negligible compared to the cost of simulating the quantum operations. The simulation package is an open-source Python implementation, called \"py-qhe-epr\", with a focus on extensive documentation and ease of use for educational, verification and adaptability purposes, supporting future research and development. Furthermore, this implementation serves as a step towards further hardware applications of quantum homomorphic encryption between networked quantum devices.","courses":["Mathematics and Statistics","Concentration in Mathematics"],"studyType":"Master of Science in Quantum Cryptography","startDate":"2022-09","endDate":"2024-10"},{"institution":"Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, Canada","location":"Vancouver, Canada","url":"https://www.sfu.ca/","courses":["Distinction in Mathematics","Minor in Philosophy","Co-operative Education"],"studyType":"Bachelor of Science in Mathematics","startDate":"2016-09","endDate":"2021-12"}],"awards":[{"title":"1st place award, QuSTEAM Quantum Hackathon Challenge  ","date":"2022-11","awarder":"qBraid","url":"https://github.com/eculf/HAQS-QUSTEAM-2022/blob/main/Quasar_notebook.ipynb"},{"title":"Undergraduate Research Prize Recepient","date":"2022-09","awarder":"Simon Fraser University","url":"https://www.sfu.ca/math/events-news/news/2022-news/2021MathUndergraduateResearchPrizes.html"},{"title":"1st Place in Data Science Competition: Analysis of BC Ferries Delay Data","date":"2019-04","awarder":"British Columbia Undergraduate Mathematics and Statistics Conference"},{"title":"Department of Mathematics Award","date":"Spring 2019","awarder":"Simon Fraser University"}],"certificates":[{"name":"Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools & Cyber Attacks by IBM","date":"2022-02","issuer":"Coursera","url":"https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/GU4XTWBBKP74","icon":"fa-solid fa-clipboard-check"},{"name":"ArcGIS Essential Training","date":"2020-05","issuer":"LinkedIn Learning","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/learning/certificates/b9e2316140db7b397b4bf20ca014069d48479d9f9f5a0a4cbd6acb2064235a71?trk=share_certificate&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3B4%2FTCrDHIQxO3jgcmpWGDWw%3D%3D","icon":"fa-solid fa-clipboard-check"},{"name":"Machine Learning by Stanford University","date":"2020-04","issuer":"Coursera","icon":"fa-solid fa-clipboard-check"},{"name":"SQL Essential Training","date":"2019-08","issuer":"LinkedIn Learning","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/learning/certificates/437b8edde19b97361dd8575a69d5903f7490d24c7ed2bcbcbd29d1f04efcc3f1?trk=share_certificate&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_certifications_details%3BIrJ8xyJwQyiI0f0KDxPfxg%3D%3D","icon":"fa-solid fa-clipboard-check"},{"name":"Learning GitHub","date":"2019-06","issuer":"Lynda.com","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/learning/certificates/590b9e68b764e052f4a7b32f71aeaf39519798140383a8796cccae28e9311ece?trk=share_certificate&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_certifications_details%3BIrJ8xyJwQyiI0f0KDxPfxg%3D%3D&original_referer=","icon":"fa-solid fa-clipboard-check"},{"name":"Python for Data Science Essential Training","date":"2018-08","issuer":"Lynda.com","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/learning/certificates/4c376db7b4d96ea0a446378cac4634c84b395e97e758c2c4b288b5b794ffe93a?trk=share_certificate&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_certifications_details%3BIrJ8xyJwQyiI0f0KDxPfxg%3D%3D","icon":"fa-solid fa-clipboard-check"}],"publications":[{"name":"Zur Elektrody/namik bewegter Körper","publisher":"Annalen der Physik","releaseDate":"1905-06-30","url":"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:On_the_Electrodynamics_of_Moving_Bodies","summary":"It concerned an interpretation of the Michelson–Morley experiment and the properties of light and time.
