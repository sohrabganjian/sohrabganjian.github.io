## 🗺️ Quantum Map: Key Areas in Quantum Information Science

Quantum information science is an interdisciplinary field that, depending on one’s approach, may require expertise in one or more disciplines, including mathematics, physics, computer science, chemistry, electrical engineering, material science, optics and photonics, and nanotechnology, among others. To gain mastery as a scientist in quantum information science, it is crucial to understand the broader quantum ecosystem, recognize the connections among its various subfields, and develop at least a surface-level understanding of each. At the same time, it is important to identify your primary area of focus and specialize deeply within it. However, as the field evolves, advancements in science will likely necessitate acquiring a more in-depth understanding of other subfields to address challenges and opportunities that are directly relevant to your work. 

Of course, knowing all of this and identifying where you fit within the field is not always obvious at the beginning. Take your time to explore, try new things, and continuously reevaluate your approach. Go again and stay persistent!

**Don't run away from them. Face them. Confront them. If you don't know enough, it will inevitably manifest itself at some point in your career!**

Below is a list of the various subfields within quantum information science:

- 🔐 Quantum Cryptography
