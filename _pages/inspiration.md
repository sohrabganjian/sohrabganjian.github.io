Ever since life began on Earth, the ultimate goal of every species has been survival: a constant tale of struggles, challenges, and overcoming arduous siutations, all for the chance to live another day and continue the cycle of life through procreation. We, as humans, are no exception either. However, coupled with itelligence, the ability to **DREAM**, and innate **CURIOUSITY**, humans have consistently overcome incredible odds. 


What is the meaning life? For a distant observer, far away in the Universe, our 80+ years of life (if we even reach that much) is merely a blip compared to the 13 billion years of the Univere's age and the vastness of the space. On this tiny speck of a planet, we are born one day and gone the next. From the external observer's perspective it might seem as if we never existed at all. But that does not render our lives void of meaning. While I will forever be a student of life, I believe we, as individuals, ought to give meaning and purpose to our existence from within.

I dedicate this page to inspiring feats of overcoming the odds as an inspiration that we have come a long way. These stories serve as a reminder, including for myself, that resilience, perseverance, determination, and the will to win dictate our outcomes, not the enviroments around us, even under the most difficult circumstances.  


It is my sincere hope that we all tap into our unrealized potentials. I beleive there is so much more within each and every one of us. 

Life is fragile. Life is precious. You won't always be on top. You won't always be at the bottom. Life has a cyclic nature. You can't live forever, but your legacy might! 

**Be humble. Be kind. Be bold. Take risks. Live life.**

		The Earth has experienced multiple mass extinction events throughout its history, one of which occurred around 66 million years ago, marking the end of the Mesozoic Era and the extinction of the dinosaurs. This event is attributed to an asteroid impact. While mammals existed at that time, they were not the dominant species. However, due to favorable traits such as small size and the ability to create burrows for protection, some mammals survived the impact and its aftermath. In the aftermath, mammals gradually became the dominant species on the planet.
		<br><br>
		One of the survivors of the impact was Morganucodon oehleri, one of the earliest mammals.

   The next time you're going through a difficult situation, remember the resilience of our ancestors and the challenges they overcame. Their resiliency and the will to survive reminds us that we, too, can endure and prevail ðŸ˜‰

		Stonehenge, located in the UK and approximately a two-hour drive from London, is estimated to be around 5,000 years old. It is one of the oldest monuments built by humans. Think about all the different rulers, kingdoms, wars, natural disasters, and everything else that has occurred over this vast span of time, and yet this structure still stands. Think about the legacy of this monument!

		<strong>Moon Landing:</strong> 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.' - Neil Armstrong.

Think about the countless scientific discoveries, sacrifices, manual labour, and the dedication of all the people behind this historic project. Not just those who lived during that era, but also the Galileos, Newtons, Einsteins, and Turings before them who laid the foundation to make this achievement possible.

		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela" target="_blank">Nelson Mandela</a> was imprisoned for 27 years, from 1962 to 1990, for his political activities and his commitment to standing against an apartheid government. He successfully dismantled the apartheid system and became the first Black president of South Africa.

		Mandela remains a global symbol of hope and determination.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_Mirzakhani" target="_blank">Maryam Mirzakhani</a> became the first woman to win the Fields Medal, often considered as the 'Nobel Prize of Math.' Overcoming many challenges, she demonstrated remarkable resilience and brilliance as a woman navigating barriers and biases in a male-dominated field. Additionally, as an immigrant from Iran, she faced unique cultural and societal challenges, making her achievements all the more extraordinary.
<br><br>
Maryam Mirzakhani's humility, perseverance, and brilliance remain an inspiring symbol, not just for mathematicians, but for men and women, minority groups, and people from all walks of life, that success is possible, even when the odds are against us.
