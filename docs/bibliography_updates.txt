# Updates to the Academic Website Configuration

## Relevant Files
- **`_pages/publication.md`**: Although not directly modified, this file organizes publication content on the website.
- **`assets/css/main.scss`**: Acts as the main SCSS entry point but was not directly modified during this process.
- **`_layouts/bib.liquid`**: Updated to include a new `<div>` wrapper for publication items with the class `publication-item`. This was essential for styling adjustments.
- **`_sass/_layout.scss`**: Added CSS rules for the `publication-item` class to enhance alignment and visibility of publication items. The following styles were added:
  ```scss
  div.publication-item {
    position: relative;
    padding-left: 10px; /* Increase space for better alignment */
  }

  div.publication-item::before {
    content: "â€¢";
    color: #{$global-colour}; /* Use the global SCSS variable */
    position: absolute;
    left: 3px; /* Adjust horizontal position */
    top: -0.47em; /* Adjust vertical position */
    font-size: 3rem; /* Increase size for better visibility */
  }
  ```
- **`_bibliography/papers.bib`**: Updated with active bibliography entries. Comments using `%` were not recognized, so unused entries were moved to a new file.
- **`_bibliography/paper_archived.bib`**: Created to store unused bibliography entries that were causing parsing errors in Jekyll Scholar.

## Summary of Changes
1. Moved unused bibliography entries from `papers.bib` to `paper_archived.bib` to prevent errors.
2. Added a new `publication-item` class in `bib.liquid` to wrap each publication entry for enhanced styling.
3. Adjusted styling in `_layout.scss` to add a prominent bullet point and improve the layout of publication items.
4. Ensured `main.scss` and `publication.md` were acknowledged as part of the relevant file structure even though no direct changes were made to them.

These updates streamline the appearance and functionality of the publications section while resolving errors caused by unused BibTeX entries.
